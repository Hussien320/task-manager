Week 1: Setting Up and Basic Backend Features
Day 1: Project Setup and User Authentication
Set up the project structure (Next.js for frontend, Express.js for backend).
Initialize basic frontend layout and backend server setup.
Implement user registration and login functionality using JWT for authentication.
Day 2-3: Database and Project Management
Set up a PostgreSQL database locally or using a cloud service (like AWS RDS).
Define Sequelize models for User, Project, and Task.
Implement CRUD operations for User model (register and login).
Start with basic frontend pages for user registration and login forms.
Day 4-5: Project CRUD Operations
Implement CRUD operations for Project model (create, read, update, delete).
Create API endpoints (/api/projects) to handle project operations.
Test project CRUD operations using Postman or similar tool.
Day 6-7: Task Management
Define Task model and its relationship with Project.
Implement CRUD operations for Task model (create, read, update, delete).
Create API endpoints (/api/projects/:projectId/tasks) for task operations.
Begin integrating frontend components for displaying and managing tasks within projects.
Week 2: Advanced Backend Features and Frontend Integration
Day 8-9: Task Status and Filtering
Enhance Task model to include status (e.g., todo, in-progress, done).
Implement API endpoints for updating task status.
Add frontend UI components for filtering tasks by status.
Day 10-11: Project Permissions and User Roles
Implement basic authorization and permissions management.
Define roles (e.g., admin, project manager, team member) and restrict actions accordingly.
Update API endpoints and frontend to enforce authorization checks.
Day 12-13: Real-time Updates and Notifications
Integrate WebSockets or polling mechanism for real-time task updates.
Implement basic notification system for task assignments or status changes.
Test real-time updates and notifications functionality.
Week 3: Security, Testing, and Deployment
Day 14-15: Security Enhancements
Implement additional security measures such as CSRF protection.
Secure API endpoints and validate input data.
Conduct security testing and ensure data encryption best practices.
Day 16-17: Testing and Bug Fixes
Perform unit tests for backend APIs and frontend components.
Conduct integration tests to ensure all features work together seamlessly.
Address and fix any bugs or issues identified during testing.
Day 18-19: Deployment Preparation
Prepare deployment scripts and configurations for backend and frontend.
Deploy backend API to a cloud platform (Heroku, AWS, etc.).
Deploy frontend application to a hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).
Day 20-21: Documentation and Final Touches
Write documentation for setup, usage, and API endpoints.
Add final touches to UI/UX design for consistency and responsiveness.
Review the entire project, ensure deployment is successful, and make any last-minute adjustments.
Summary
Starting feature by feature allows you to focus on building and testing each part of your project systematically. This approach helps in managing complexity, ensuring each feature works as intended before moving on to the next. Adjust the plan as needed based on your progress and specific requirements of your Task Management System project. Good luck with your development journey!
